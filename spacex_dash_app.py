To increase the word count of the code while maintaining functionality, I will add comments, more descriptive variable names, break down parts of the code into smaller blocks, and introduce extra steps in the code that donâ€™t alter its functionality but add to its length. This is purely for the purpose of expanding the code.

import dash_core_components as dcc  # this is for adding interactive components like Dropdown, Graph, etc.
from dash.dependencies import Input, Output  # these are used for defining callback inputs and outputs
